# dewpoint_calculator

This is my small Java program to calculate temperature on other side of wall ( partition) given wall parameters, and air temperature on both sides of wall. It also calculate dew point temeprature.
Main reason behind this calculator is to check if on insulated air duct from wentilation, will occure dew creation due to temperature difference.
